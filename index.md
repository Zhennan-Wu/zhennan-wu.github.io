# Zhennan(Leo)'s Homepage

Hello, welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student of computer science at [Indiana University, Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu). I am adviced by [Roni Khardon](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/rkhardon/). 

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially understanding the theoretical properties of various RL methods
and designing better algorithms.

Currently I am working on understanding the roles of probabilistic inference in planning and RL.

## News
3/2022: New preprint[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12139.pdf]: develops a framework that captures many algorithms connecting stochastic planning and approximate probabilistic inference, and evaluates some old and new planning algorithms based on belief propagation and variational approximations.
