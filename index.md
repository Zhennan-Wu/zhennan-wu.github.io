# Zhennan(Leo)'s Homepage

Hello, welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student of computer science at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am adviced by [Roni Khardon](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/rkhardon/). 

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, especially understanding the theoretical properties of various RL methods
and designing better algorithms.

Currently I am working on planning as inference.
