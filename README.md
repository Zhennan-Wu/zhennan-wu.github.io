## Welcome to My Homepage

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student of computer science at Indiana University, Bloomington. I am adviced by Roni Khardon. 

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, especially understanding the theoretical properties of various RL methods. 
Currently I am working on planning as inference.
